# SEPIA Client Installation - Raspberry Pi

## Common Instructions

Last tested with Raspberry Pi OS 2021-05 (aka Raspian Buster) and RPi4 B 2GB-4GB.  
Expected to work with RPi3 1GB and might even work with RPi Zero 512GB if wake-word is disabled.

### 1) Install Raspberry Pi OS Lite

* Download Raspberry Pi OS Lite (the version without desktop)
* Flash MicroSD with Etcher
* Remove MicroSD and replug (to reload filesystem)
* Add an empty file called 'ssh' to the boot folder ([microSD]/boot) to enable SSH
* Add a file called 'wpa_supplicant.conf' with the following content to the boot folder to enable WiFi login (replace 'country' [US, DE, ..], 'ssid' and 'psk'):
```
country=US
ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
update_config=1
network={
    ssid="NETWORK-NAME"
    psk="NETWORK-PASSWORD"
	id_str="Home"
}
```
* Eject the MicroSD and plug it into your RPi
* Connect to your RPi via SSH (in Windows you can use [putty](https://www.putty.org/))
* Finish your RPi setup with `sudo raspi-config` (expand SD card, set timezone, etc.)

### 2a) SEPIA Client Installation

* Connect your hardware to the RPi (USB mic, ReSpeaker HAT, Hyperpixel touchscreen, etc.)
* Create installation folder `mkdir -p ~/install` and switch to directory `cd ~/install`
* Download one of the install packages:
  * Current release version: `wget https://github.com/SEPIA-Framework/sepia-installation-and-setup/raw/master/sepia-client-installation/sepia_client_rpi_raspbian_buster.zip`
  * Developer version: `wget https://github.com/SEPIA-Framework/sepia-installation-and-setup/raw/dev/sepia-client-installation/sepia_client_rpi_raspbian_buster.zip`
* `unzip sepia_client_rpi_raspbian_buster.zip`
* If you have hardware like a ReSpeaker mic HAT or Hyperpixel touchscreen etc. consider to run step "2b) Install Hardware" (see below) first
* Run the install script. Optionally use the arguments `dev` and/or `skipBLE`, e.g.:
  * Default: `bash install_sepia_client.sh`
  * Most recent developer version (client dev branch): `bash install_sepia_client.sh dev`
  * Skip installation of Bluetooth interface: `bash install_sepia_client.sh skipBLE`
* **Reboot** the system

### 2b) Install Hardware (optional)

* **USB microphone** and the audio jack for sound:
  * This script might be useful to set the correct default devices: `bash install_usb_mic.sh`
  * **Reboot** the system
* For **WM8960 microphone boards** like ReSpeaker (2 and 4 mic HAT), Waveshare Audio-HAT, Adafruit Voice Bonnet:
  * Install drivers: `bash install_respeaker_mic.sh`
  * Run `bash update_respeaker_boot.sh` to deactivate unused RPi default audio jack
  * **Reboot** the system
* For **Hyperpixel** touchscreen:
  * Install drivers: `curl https://get.pimoroni.com/hyperpixel4 | bash`
  * **Reboot** the system
  * If you have problems with the touchscreen (swapped axis etc.) run `bash update_hyperpixel4_boot.sh`
* Tweak for small displays to fix Chromium "bug" (use AFTER step "2a SEPIA Client Installation" is finished):
  * If your screen width is smaller than 500px, e.g. 480px (typical Hyperpixel width) you can use `bash adapt_to_small_screen.sh 20` to shift the screen by 20px

### 3) Run SEPIA Client Setup

* Run `bash setup.sh` from the `~/sepia-client` folder
* Select your mode: 'display' (manual setup), 'headless' (no display, auto-setup) or 'pseudo-headless' (auto-setup but keep using display)
* Set SEPIA server host address (as you would inside your SEPIA app login box)
* Optional: Define a unique device ID (default is 'o1', Android apps have 'a1' and browsers 'b1' by default)
* Optional: Define a new CLEXI-ID (this can be used as password for the remote terminal later, default is: clexi-123)
* Finish your setup by setting automatic login via `sudo raspi-config` (Boot options - Desktop/CLI - Console Autologin)
* Reboot your system 
* Your headless client should automatically start and notify you via a short audio message that he'll be "right there"

### 4) Configure the Client via Remote Connection

* Continue the setup in your [SEPIA Control HUB](https://github.com/SEPIA-Framework/sepia-admin-tools/tree/master/admin-web-tools) by opening the 'client connections' page. Make sure to use the HTTP address (not HTTPS) to avoid mixed-content errors due to the 'ws://' URL below!
* The CLEXI server of your newly installed SEPIA Client should be reachable at `ws://[rpi-IP]:9090/clexi` (via Nginx proxy)
* Enter your CLEXI-ID from the previous step (or use the default) and press the 'CONNECT' button. The remote terminal window at the bottom will show the status of the connection.
* By default your headless client will start the 'setup mode'. This might take a while, depending on your RPi model. You should hear the audio message "ready for setup" at some point
* Use the remote terminal to ping all connected clients by typing `ping all` or use the shortcut button right above the terminal input field
* Your SEPIA Client should answer with client info, device ID and a short message. If this is not the case something went wrong during the setup. Try to reboot your RPi and observe your CLEXI connection status.
* Copy the device ID into the field with the same name (right above the shortcut buttons)
* Use the remote terminal command `call login user [user-ID] password [user-pwd]` (message type: 'SEPIA Client') to login your user
* You should see a "login successful" message in the terminal. If not you can use the command `call ping` to see if the client can reach the SEPIA server. Check your "hostname" settings from the previous step (Client Setup) if ping fails
* Use the command `call test` (message type: 'SEPIA Client') or corresponding shortcut button 'test client' to ... test your client. You should hear an acoustic confirmation
* Reboot your system one last time to finish the configuration (NOTE: your microphone will only have access permission AFTER the reboot)

### 5) Fine Tuning

* Optional: Open the CLEXI settings.json file located at `~/clexi/www/sepia/settings.js` to tweak your client (e.g. activate "Hey SEPIA"). NOTE: please do this AFTER a successful configuration and reboot (previous step)
* Done. Enjoy! :-)

## Basic uninstallation steps

There is no uninstall script yet and some things will depend on your specific installation variant. The easiest way is to simply reinstall the OS but here are roughly the required steps:
* Open the folder `~/sepia-client` and run `shutdown.sh`
* Delete folder `~/sepia-client`
* Delete folder `~/clexi`
* Delete folder `~/.config/openbox` and remove 'openbox' via `sudo apt-get remove openbox`
* Remove (any) Chromium via `sudo apt-get remove chromium chromium-browser`
* Open `~/.bashrc` and remove the SEPIA entry below '# Run SEPIA-Client on login?'
* Delete, check or adjust your ALSA config `~/.asoundrc` pr√ºfen oder entfernen

Whats left are packages like Node.js, Xserver and hardware related stuff (if you've installed a touchscreen or microphone etc.).
